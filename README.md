## Introduction 

This app has been created as a solo project for our final exercice for the bootcamp study. I decided to create a resume generator as I always though that it will be better to have to spend much time on it so that you can focus on other things.

## Links

**[Resume Generator](https://resume-generator-tl.herokuapp.com/)**

**[Resume Generator Repository](https://github.com/TristanLibeau/resume-generator)**

## Install

Simple git clone the repository in your pc, run npm install, npm run build and npm run develop and the app should opening in your browser in localhost.

Then you can simply create an account to be able to use the resume generator.
